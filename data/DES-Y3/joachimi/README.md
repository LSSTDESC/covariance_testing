covdesnz1.param contains many of the parameter choices

source.nz has the source n(z)'s for each tomographic bin; this is identical to the one in the cosmolike directory

nz2 has a more realistic ellipticity noise setting with \sigma_e varying in each of the tomographic bins according
to Table 1 in Troxel et al 2017

First step is to run:

$ cosmosis params_derivative.ini

This will create the folder "derivative-values", which will later be used in the
compression.

Next, run:

python get_coeff.py

This is where the compression happens. It will compress the covariance in the
.fits file in this folder.
The parameter values in get_coeff.py should be the same as those in
values-derivative.ini.

These files were created by Niyani Chen and modified accordingly for our needs.

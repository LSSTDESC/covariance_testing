	\begin{abstract}
		
		%There  are a number of codes that compute covariance matrices analytically; the plan is to use these to build TJPCov. In this project, we start along the path of comparing these different codes, building up a suite of tools that can be used to compare covariance matrices. We expect these tools to be useful not only for converging on a single accurate code for computing covariance matrices but also more generally for understanding which parts of the covariance matrix carry the most information (and therefore need the most attention to get right) and which are not relevant (so for example matrices that are not positive definite may still be usable if the negative eigenmodes are not relevant).
		
		In this paper, we start along the path of comparing covariance matrices for cosmic shear statistics generated by two different codes. The main goal is to identify the parts of the covariance matrix that are most significant to parameter estimation, and therefore which ones should be calculated correctly. We engage different ways of doing this, starting with a simple one-to-one comparison of the elements, then moving on to eigenvalues and finally to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the spirit of reducing the number of relevant elements, we “remove” 200 modes associated with the highest eigenvalues, then those with the lowest SNR. We find that we were unable to locate the most important elements with the first method, but while the analysis with the SNR proved resourceful for a few parameters of interest, like $\Omega_m$, we lost constraining power on the intrinsic alignment (IA) parameters as well as $S_8$. We also tested ways to shrink the covariance matrix, both at the tomographic level, and for the two-point functions. The former was accomplished using a method based on the Karhunen-Lo\'eve (KL) decomposition to obtain the modes with highest SNR, and we show that in order to reproduce compatible results we need at least two KL-modes, but, just like in the SNR case, this is not the case for all parameters. Finally, we apply a lossless compression scheme to the covariance matrix, capable of reducing the dimension to the number of free parameters. We were able to reproduce the constraints obtained previously and show that the elements of the new matrix have an error tolerance of up to $25\%$.

	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:intro}
	
	Almost all analyses of cosmological data use a likelihood function that requires a covariance matrix. If the data set has $N$ data points, the covariance matrix is a symmetric $N\times N$ and captures the errors in the measurements, including those that are correlated from one point to another. As data sets grow, the number of elements in the covariance matrix is becoming too large to verify each individual element. For example, we will focus on cosmic shear measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES)~\cite{Troxel:2017xyo}; in that case, the data vector has 227 elements, varying with angular separation, and different pairs of tomographic redshift bins. In this case, then, the number of independent elements of the covariance matrix is $227\times 228/2=25,878$. Which of these are most important to get right? What should the tolerance be when comparing different techniques or even different codes using the same technique? How many simulations need to be run in order to obtain accurate enough covariance matrices? 
	
	Here we attempt to address these questions by considering several increasingly complex methods of identifying the elements of the covariance matrix that are most relevant. Although we will consider only the one example of DES cosmic shear measurements and projections, we think that our conclusions will be useful more generally. In \S\ref{sec:methods}, we describe the data set used and the pair of covariance matrices constructed in order to test different validation schemes. The next 3 sections walk through increasingly complex ways of determining the most important parts of these matrices. Before diving in, we comment that a very simple way to compare two covariance matrices is to see whether they obtain the same final parameter constraints. We will use this metric a bit throughout but want to emphasize here that our goals are a bit more ambitious: simply finding out that two covariance matrices give different results is a black-box approach. One cannot identify the source of the disagreement. The methods described here aim to go a bit deeper to try to understand where the key differences arise and which differences are most important.
	
	Another goal of this work is to reduce the number of relevant elements of the covariance matrices to about 10\% their original size. We first do this by ``throwing away" 200 modes of the covariance matrix associated with the highest eigenvalues, then those with lowest signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we apply a lossless compression scheme capable of reducing the dimension to the number of free parameters, leaving us with a $16 \times 16$ covariance matrix.
	
	\section{DES Cosmic Shear: Data and Analysis}
	\label{sec:methods}
	
	In this section, we explain the methodology used for each of the tests employed for the analysis and comparison of the covariance matrices. Our tests are carried out using cosmic shear statistics $\xi_\pm(\theta)$, focusing on the Year 1 results of the Dark Energy Survey \citep{Troxel:2017xyo,Abbott:2018cms} (DESY1). The data is divided into four tomographic redshift bins spanning the interval $0.20 < z < 1.30$, which yields 10 bin-pair combinations, each one containing 20 angular bins between 2.5 and 250 arcmin. We thus begin with 200 data points for each $\xi_+(\theta)$ and $\xi_-(\theta)$, giving 400 in total. We then apply the angular cuts described in \citep{Abbott:2018cms}, which removes the scales most sensitive to baryonic effects; this leaves 167 points for $\xi_+(\theta)$ and 60 for $\xi_-(\theta)$, resulting in 227 data points corresponding to the aforementioned $227 \times 227$ covariance matrix. 
	
	Table~\ref{tab:constraints} shows the 16 parameters varied and the priors placed on them. To perform cosmological parameter inference we use the {\tt CosmoSIS} \citep{Zuntz:2015med, Lewis2000taj, Kirk2012mnras, Kilbinger2009aa, Howlett2012jcap, Bridle2007njp, Takahashi2012taj, Smith2003mnras} pipeline, while employing the {\tt MultiNest} \citep{Feroz:2009fhb} sampler to explore the parameter space, with 500 {\tt livepoints}, {\tt efficiency} set to 0.3, {\tt tolerance} to 0.1 and {\tt constant efficiency} set to False.

		\label{tab:constraints}
	\end{table}
	
	The covariance matrices are obtained using two different codes: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\tt Cosmolike} \citep{Krause:2016jvl} (CL) was used in the initial DESY1 analysis;
		\item we ran the code used to analyse the KiDS-450 survey \citep{Kohlinger:2017sxk} (BJ) using DESY1 parameters and tomographic bins but using only the gaussian part. 
	\end{itemize}
	Thus, throughout, the covariance labels CL and BJ differ for several reasons: first, they are two independent codes and, second, BJ was run with very simple settings. To be clear, the BJ code does contain all the functionality in CL, but, in order to accentuate the differences, we ran with the simplest settings. The ensuing larger differences will help us assess different validation techniques. Where not otherwise stated, the analysis and constraints will be performed on the CL covariance matrix.
	
	\figref{y3-comparison} shows the results for the projected cosmological constraints for CL. These projections use the same data vector and cuts, but the two different covariance matrices. The $2\sigma$ constraints are as follows: for CL: $\Omega_m= 0.306^{+ 0.073}_{- 0.060}$, $A = 0.852^{+ 1.005}_{- 1.086}$ and $S_8 = 0.784^{+ 0.200}_{- 0.171}$; and for BJ: $\Omega_m = 0.309^{+ 0.073}_{- 0.058}$, 	$A = 0.948^{+ 0.916}_{- 0.985}$ and $S_8 = 0.787^{+ 0.196}_{- 0.166}$. This shows that the differences we have introduced to the calculation of the two matrices are mensurable in the parameter constraints.
	%The best-fit values agree within 1-$\sigma$ but the constraints are up to $25\%$ broader when the DES covariance matrix is used. \scott{not sure this is clear: can we simply quote the 1-sigma errors?} This is also true for the other parameters, where, on average, constraints obtained with DES are about $18\%$ wider.

The purple curve is for CL while the blue is for BJ. In the 16 parameter space, the volume of the posterior is about $22\%$ larger for the former. \label{fig:y3-comparison}}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	
	\section{Element-by-element comparison}
	
	If there was only a single data point, then the covariance matrix would contain only a single number and comparing two covariance matrices to try to understand why they give different constraints would be as simple as comparing these two numbers.  The simplest generalization of this is to do an element-by-element comparison of the two covariance matrices.
	We make a scatter plot of the elements of the two matrices in the bottom panel of \figref{one-to-one}, where we can see that the elements of CL are, in general, larger than BJ's, differing by up to 4 orders of magnitude. In some ways, this is useful and reassuring, as it aligns with what we see in the parameter constraints, as shown in Figure \rf{y3-comparison}: larger elements in the covariance matrix translates to less constraining power.
	
	The limitation of this brute-force method is that it remains unclear which of the differences are driving the final discrepancies in parameter constraints. This difficulty is an outgrowth of the increasing size of the data sets and hence the growing number of elements of the covariance matrix that any two codes are likely to disagree on. This element-by-element comparison, however, would prove much more useful if we could first determine the important elements. Towards that end, we start by turning to the eigenvalues.
	
	\begin{figure}
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Scatter_CL-BJ.pdf}
		\caption{In both plots, the red points refer to the diagonal elements, and the colour bar varies according to the number of elements in one hexagonal bin, where the darkest blue colour corresponds to only one element, and the brightest yellow shade to 2000. \textbf{Top:} Scatter plot of the ratio of the elements of CL and BJ vs the BJ value. For illustrative purposes, we draw a black, horizontal line at CL/BJ = 1. \textbf{Bottom:} Density of the scatter plot of the positive elements of the covariance matrices BJ and CL, with the black line showing $x=y$.
			\label{fig:one-to-one}}
	\end{figure}
	
	\section{Eigenvalues}
	
	The next simplest thing to try is to explore the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Each is associated with a linear combination of the data vector, or a \emph{mode}, and it is possible that identifying the modes that have the most discrepant eigenvalues will give guidance on how to reconcile differences.  We plot the eigenvalues for these matrices in \figref{coveigen}. At a first glance, both curves show reasonable agreement, with values differing only by an average of $\approx 13\%$.
	
	
	\begin{figure}
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Eigenvalues/Eigenvalues_Y1_BJ-DES.pdf}
		\caption{A log plot showing the $227$ eigenvalues of CL (blue) and BJ (orange). \label{fig:coveigen}}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	The lowest eigenvalues correspond to modes with the smallest variance but since they are not normalized, it is unclear how this variance compares to the signal in the mode. Let us nonetheless explore the possibility that the modes with the lowest variance provide the most information and therefore dropping the modes with the largest eigenvalues would not affect the final result.
	
	Our procedure consists of first diagonalizing the covariance matrix in order to calculate its eigenvalues and then replacing the large eigenvalues with numbers much larger (nine orders of magnitude higher), thus removing their effective contribution; we then rotate back to the original basis and perform a cosmological analysis with the new covariance matrix, to constrain the parameters of our model. 
	
	\figref{eig_snr} shows the results obtained after ``removing" the 200 modes with the largest eigenvalues by following the method described above.  The constraints are significantly broader for the three parameters shown. This is consistent with the fact that we are throwing away about 90\% of the information. However, it is inconsistent with the notion that these modes are irrelevant, in fact, constraints on $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ for the original covariance matrix are $0.784^{+ 0.200}_{- 0.171}$, whereas, for this procedure, we obtain $0.679^{+ 0.533}_{- 0.505}$, showing an increase in almost 200\%. It is then clear that a different way of ordering the modes, other than simply looking at the eigenvalues, is called for.

		\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Parameters.pdf}
		\caption{Constraints on cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$, $S_8$ and the intrinsic alignment parameter $A$ for the original CL covariance matrix (in purple) and for two new covariance matrices obtained by setting the 200 highest eigenvalues of the original matrix to nine orders of magnitude higher (in blue), and by replacing the 200 lowest values of the SNR to seven order of magnitude lower (in magenta). \label{fig:eig_snr}}
	\end{figure}
	
	% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	\section{Signal-to-noise ratio}
	
	Instead of looking only at the ``noise'' -- or the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix -- a better way to assess the importance of modes is to consider the signal as well. We can define the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as
	\be
	\left(\frac{S}{N}\right)^2 = \sum_{ij} T_i C^{-1}_{ij} T_j\
	,\ee
	where $T_i$ and are the predicted theoretical signal for the $i^{th}$ data point and $C$ is the covariance matrix. If $C$ were diagonal, then the eigenvectors would simply be the data points themselves, and we could estimate the SNR squared expected in each mode by simply computing $T_i^2/C_{ii}$. Then we could throw out the modes with the lowest SNR. Since $C$ is not diagonal, we have to first diagonalize it and then order the values. So, we write the expected SNR squared as
	\bea
	\left(\frac{S}{N}\right)^2 %&=& %\sum_{ij} T_i  C^{-1}_{ij} T_j\nonumber\\
	&=& \sum_{i} \frac{v_i^2}{\lambda_i}
	,\eea
	where $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, which is diagonalized with the unitary matrix $U$, and the eigenvectors are 
	\be
	v_i\equiv U_{ij}^T T_j\
	.\ee
	This makes it very clear which modes should be kept and which should be dropped. Modes $v_i$ for which $v_i^2/\lambda_i$ is very small can be discarded. 
	
	After obtaining the SNR for the covariance matrix, we proceed to set the 200 lowest values to seven orders of magnitude lower, which is equivalent to increasing the noise (or decreasing the signal) of these modes. We then obtain a new covariance matrix with the corresponding modified SNR values. 
	
	The parameter constraints for this method are shown in \figref{eig_snr}, where we note that only $\Omega_m$ is well constrained (in agreement with those obtained with the original covariance matrix to within a $2\sigma$ interval). The constraining power on $A$ and $S_8$, on the other hand, is very much lost, which suggests that the modes removed do indeed carry relevant information for these parameters. This is surprising since these were identified as those that had the lowest SNR. 
	
	Resolving this requires us to tweak our understanding of which modes carry information. The ``signal'' these modes are ordered by is the amplitude of the data points.  The parameters though are sensitive to the shape as well as the amplitude.
	To address this, we can identify the SNR for each parameter individually. To illustrate this, we take
	\bea
	\left(\frac{\partial S/\partial p_\alpha}{N}\right)^2 = \sum_{i} \frac{(\partial v_i / \partial p_\alpha)^2}{\lambda_i}
	\eea
	%	with
	%	\be
	%	v_i^\alpha \equiv U_{ij}^T \frac{\partial T_j}{\partial p_\alpha}
	%	,\ee
	where $\partial /\partial p_\alpha$ is the derivative with respect to each parameter. This produces the SNR for each parameter of interest. The importance of this procedure is illustrated in \figref{signalnoise_cuts}, which shows the normalised vanilla SNR for a given mode on the $x$-axis and the SNR for each parameter for the same mode, for brevity, we show only for $\Omega_m$ and $A$. The shaded region is the one excluded in the previous analysis, but clearly there are some low SNR modes there that contain information about the parameters. This is particularly true for the intrinsic alignment parameter $A$, which seems to explain the poor constraints shown in \figref{eig_snr}. As a result, simply cutting on raw SNR loses constraining power.
	
	\begin{figure}
		\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{SNR/SNR_200_omA.pdf}
		\caption{Scatter plot for the relation between the signal to noise obtained with the covariance matrix for CL for each parameter (x-axis) against that for the full set of parameters (y-axis). The derivatives are shown with respect to $\Omega_m$ (blue circle) and for the intrinsic alignment parameters $A$ (orange triangle). The purple rectangle spreads until the two hundredth lowest value of SNR, which corresponds to the values that are modified for parameter constraints. \label{fig:signalnoise_cuts}}

	\section{Shrinkage}
	\label{subsec:shrinkage}
	
	Since the simplest methods of identifying the most relevant modes are flawed, we turn to more sophisticated methods \citep{Tegmark:1997maa, Joachimi:2017mnr,Gualdi:2018gmj} that have been shown to reduce the number of modes significantly but still retain the relevant information. First, there is compression at the map level \citep{Alonso:2017hhj}, where linear combinations of the tomographic maps are used to retain as much information as possible. Compression at the map level then significantly reduces the size of the data vector of two-point functions. For example, we will see that most of the information in the four tomographic bins used by DESY1 can be compressed into a single linear combination of those bins. Therefore, instead of $(4\times5)/2$ two-point functions for each angular bin, we need include only one: the compression in the size of the data vector by a factor of 10 means that there are a hundred fewer elements of the covariance matrix to study.
	
	The second method directly operates on the two-point functions themselves \citep{Zablocki:2015zcm}, where the modes used are those that maximize the Fisher information for each of the cosmological parameters. Here the size of the data vector is just the number of parameters used to fit the data (i.e. 16), so the compression eliminates even more modes than the tomographic compression. Roughly, though, the numbers are the same: a data vector reduced by a factor of ten and the number of elements in the covariance matrix reduced by a factor of 100. 
	
	\subsection{Tomographic Compression}
	
	This compression method is based on Karhunen-Lo\'eve (KL) decomposition for the shear power spectrum suggested by \citep{Alonso:2017hhj} and later applied to real space 2-point function in \citep{Bellini:2019ssw} for CFHTLens survey. This method generally finds the eigenmode with most of the signal-to-noise ratio contribution to the power spectrum, and then transforms the 2-point function in real space based on this eigenmode.
	
	With  {\tt CosmoSIS}, we can generate the shear power spectrum $C_{\ell}^{ij}$ of convergence $a_{\ell m}$ for a fiducial cosmology. The cosmology we choose is the best-fit value of the DES Year 1 results for cosmic shear only. With the shear power spectrum $C_{\ell}=S_{\ell}+N_{\ell}$ and its shape noise $N_{\ell}$, we can calculate the Karhunen-Lo\'eve (KL) modes matrix $E_{\ell}$ via a general eigenvalue problem 
	\be
	C^{ij}_{\ell} E^j_{\ell} = \lambda^i_{\ell} N^{ij}_{\ell} E^j_{\ell}
	.\ee
	Each row in $E_{\ell}$ corresponds to a KL-mode of $C_{\ell}$. Using the Cholesky decomposition, $N_{\ell} = L L^{\dagger}$, the new observable can be expressed as $b_{\ell m} = E_{\ell} \cdot L^{-1} a_{\ell m}$. We should note that $C_{\ell}$ is the power spectrum of the convergence of the weak lensing, and $E_{\ell}$ is the transformation of basis for the convergence. So, we can now calculate the power spectrum $D_{\ell}$ for the new observable $b_{\ell m}$ 
	\be
	D_{\ell} =\ <b_{\ell m} b_{\ell m}^T>\ = E_{\ell} L^{-1} C_{\ell} L^{-1} E^{T}_{\ell}\
	,\ee
	or, if we denote $E_{\ell} N^{-1}$ as $R_{\ell}$, we can write the compression in one simple linear combination of the $C_{\ell}$,
	\be
	D_{\ell} = R_{\ell}^i C_{\ell}^{ij} R_{\ell}^j = U_{\ell}^{ij} C_{\ell}^{ij}\
	.\ee
	The double summation weight $U_{\ell}^{ij}$ is what we use to perform tomographic compression. We should point out that these KL-modes are uncorrelated, so the power spectrum of the new observable $D_{\ell}$ is a diagonal matrix, with 1+SNR of the corresponding eigenmodes on the diagonal elements. Since the KL-decomposed modes of shear power spectrum are uncorrelated, we can make a compression here by taking only the first one or two modes with the highest SNR. By doing so, we compress 10 tomographic combinations to 1 or 2.
	
	We want, however, to eventually compress the 2-point function data vector of DESY1. One possible way is to calculate the 2-point function of the KL mode of the shear power spectrum. We can calculate this from the shear power spectrum by
	\be
	\xi_{\pm}^{ij}(\theta) = \int \frac{\ell d \ell }{2\pi}J_{0/4}(\ell \theta) C^{ij}(\ell)\
	.\ee
	In order to compress $\xi_{\pm}$ based on the compression of the $C_{\ell}$, we need to make sure that our scheme is $\ell$-independent, that is to say, the 2-point correlation function of $D_{\ell}$, $\Tilde{\xi}_{\pm}(\theta)$, can be directly calculated from other 2-point functions. We then have,
	\bea
	\nonumber\Tilde{\xi}_{\pm}(\theta) &=& \int \frac{\ell d \ell }{2\pi}J_{0/4}(\ell \theta) D(\ell)\\\nonumber
	&=&\int \frac{\ell d \ell }{2\pi}J_{0/4}(\ell \theta) U^{ij}C^{ij}(\ell)\\
	&=&U^{ij}\xi_{\pm}^{ij}(\theta)\
	,\eea
	where $U^{ij}$, the $\ell$-independent compression weight is calculated by 
	\be
	U^{ij} = \frac{\int_{\ell _{\mathrm{min}}}^{\ell _{\mathrm{max}}} (2 \ell +1) U^{ij}_{\ell}}{\int_{\ell _{\mathrm{min}}}^{\ell _{\mathrm{max}}} (2 \ell +1)}\
	.\ee
	We make a more conservative angular cut than the one discussed in \cite{Troxel:2017xyo}, making sure that both $\xi_{\pm}$ are uniform in regard to tomographic combinations. We consider an angular scale for  $\xi_+$ from $7.195^{\circ}$ to $250.0^{\circ}$, and for $\xi_-$ from $90.579^{\circ}$ to $250.0^{\circ}$. Therefore, for the purpose of demonstrating KL-transform, the raw data vector has a length of 190, and by shrinking 10 tomographic combinations for each angle into 1 KL-mode, the data is shrunk to 19, and so the number of elements in the covariance matrices are reduced by 99\%.
	
	%We characterize a given element in the data vector by its angular and tomographic indices: $a_i = a_{\ell m,\alpha}$ where $l,m$ denote the indices corresponding to given spherical harmonics and $\alpha$ is a given tomographic bin, or equivalently $a_i = a_\alpha(\vec\theta)$ in real space. The compression occurs in terms of tomographic bins, so that 
	%\be
	%b_\mu(\vec\theta) = \sum_{\alpha} F_{\mu\alpha} a_\alpha(\theta)
	%\ee
	%where the $F$'s are chosen \footnote{Note that this definition of $F$ differs from that in \citep{Alonso:2017hhj} in that it includes the inverse of the noise matrix.} so that the correlation functions of the $b$'s are diagonal in tomographic space:
	%\bea
	%w_{\mu\nu}(\theta) &=& \langle b_\mu(\vec\theta_1) b_\nu(\vec\theta_2)\rangle\vert_{\vert\vec\theta_1-\vec\theta_2\vert\in\theta}
	%\svs
	% &=& \delta_{\mu,\nu} w_{\mu}(\theta).
	%\eea
	%Usually with $N_t$ tomographic bins, one must consider $N_t(N_t+1)/2$ correlation functions, but -- due to the transformation that diagonalizes the elements -- there are only $N_t$ correlation functions to consider (for a given $\theta$). Even better, these can be ordered by the information they contain, so fewer than $N_t$ can be used. In the example used in \citep{Alonso:2017hhj}, 16 tomographic bins were assumed, so that the standard treatment would require 136 correlation functions, but only 3 were needed in order to extract accurate constraints. 
	
	%This method suggests a way of extracting the most important pieces of the full covariance matrix $C$. We simply compute the covariance matrix of the $w_{\mu}$ in terms of $C$ and keep only the most important terms. That is,
	%\bea
	%C^b_{\mu\nu} &\equiv& \langle (w_{\mu} -\bar w_\mu)\,(w_{\nu} -\bar w_\nu)\rangle
	%\svs
	% &=& \sum_{\alpha\alpha'\beta\beta'} F_{\mu\alpha}F_{\mu\alpha'}\, F_{\nu\beta}F_{\nu\beta'}\, C_{\alpha\alpha'\beta\beta'} .
	%\eea
	%Here the angular indices have been suppressed (there are two of them, one for each $w_\mu$), but the full tomographic complexity has been retained. The covariance matrix on the right includes a total of $N_t^2 \times N_t^2$ terms (some of which are equal because of symmetry) corresponding to all possible pairs of 2-point functions. But $C^b$ on the right contains only $N_t^2$ elements, and again these are ordered, so we can use only a subset of them. In the simplest case, where only one linear combination is needed so $\mu=\nu=1$, a single number (for each pair of angular bins) captures all the relevant information from the full covariance matrix.
	
	With  {\tt CosmoSIS}, we calculate the shear power spectrum $C_{\ell}$ of DES Year 1 with a fiducial cosmology at the best-fit parameters, and $\ell$-range $2-2500$. The left plot in \figref{ClDl}, shows the diagonal elements of the signal part and the noise part of $C_{\ell}$, while the right one shows the KL-transformed eigenmode $D_{\ell}$ of $C_{\ell}$. We can see that the first KL mode contains most of the SNR contribution to the power spectrum. However, if we want to recover more information, we also should include the second and the cross mode between the first and second KL-mode.

	\end{figure*}
	
	In \figref{kl-mode}, we plot the normalized KL-eigenmode $E_\ell^i$ of $C_{\ell}$ and its corresponding $U^{ij}_\ell=E_\ell^i E_\ell^j$. Modes with different $\ell$ are plotted in increasing shades of the color. We can see that the KL-modes do not depend significantly on the scale factor $\ell$, so we also take the weighted average of the eigenmodes $E_\ell^p$ and its quadratic form $W_\ell$ over $\ell$'s and plot them with black lines. 	For different $\ell$, the KL-modes do vary by a slight amount. For the first KL-mode, the tomographic bins with higher redshift gain more weight than those with low redshift. This is also shown by the weight on tomographic combination that the combination of bin 3 and bin 4 gains most of the weight to maximize signal-to-noise ratio. This agrees with the fact that the diagonal elements $C_\ell$ for low redshift is much less than those with high redshift.

	\end{figure}
	
	We perform KL-compression with the first mode and with the first two modes separately. In \figref{comp-cov}, we plot the compressed covariance matrices for CL and BJ with the first mode only, and show a one-to-one comparison of the covariance matrices. Looking back at the bottom plot in \figref{one-to-one}, we can easily notice that the large regions containing the elements with greater difference are now gone. Instead, the two covariance matrices just have a relative constant difference, because, unlike CL, BJ does not include the non-gaussian effects. This shows that the divergence between CL and BJ covariance does not considerably affect the overall SNR.

		\caption{ Cosmological constraints marginalized over all-16 parameters for the original CL covariance matrix and that compressed by the first KL-mode and the first two KL-modes.\label{fig:kl-constraints}}
	\end{figure}
	We run the likelihood analysis with the first KL-mode and the first two KL-modes, which correspond to a 10-to-1 and 10-to-3 compression, respectively, and show the parameter constraints on the $\Omega_m - S_8 - A$ plane in \figref{kl-constraints}. We can see in the figure that the first KL-mode is generally not enough to recover the information in the data vector. Since the first two modes contain most of the SNR contribution on the map level, we were able to recover the $\Omega_m$ constraints. However, the recovery on the $S_8$ and $A$ is not desirable. This could be due to the fact that the SNR-prioritized modes are not the sensitive direction for these parameters, as was also the case in \figref{signalnoise_cuts}. Indeed, the $S_8 - A$ plane shows a strong correlation between these two parameters. This could explain why the $S_8$ constraints got wider: the KL-modes fail to break the degeneracy on $A$, which is mostly contained in the modes that are insensitive to cosmic shear.
	
	\subsection{Linear combinations of the data vector}
	
	The compression here  takes place at the two-point level \citep{Zablocki:2015zcm}, with the compressed data vector containing linear combinations of the many two-point functions. In principle, this might work with only $N_p$ two-point functions where $N_p$ is the number of free parameters, and each mode, or linear combination, contains all the information necessary about the parameter of interest. 
	
	For each parameter $p_\alpha$ that is varied, one captures a single linear mode
	\be
	y_\alpha = U_{\alpha i} D_i\
	,\ee
	where $D_i$ are the data points and the coefficients are defined as
	\be \label{eq:compression_scheme}
	U_{\alpha i} \equiv \frac{\partial T_j}{\partial p_\alpha} \, C^{-1}{}_{ji}\
	,\ee
	with $T_j$ being the theoretical prediction for the data point $D_j$. An illustration of the matrix $U_{\alpha i}$ is shown in \figref{weight2pt}, constraining the weighting vector for parameters $\Omega_m$, $S_8$ and $A$.
	
	The now much smaller data set $\{y_\alpha\}$, which contains as few as $N_p$ data points, carries with it its own covariance matrix, with which the $\chi^2$ can be computed for each point in parameter space. Propagating through shows that this covariance matrix is related to the original $C_{ij}$ via
	\be
	C_{\alpha\beta} = U_{\alpha i} C_{ij} U^T_{j\beta}.
	\ee
	In our case, our covariance matrix is  $227 \times 227$, while the number of parameters needed to specify the model is only 16, so $C_{\alpha\beta}$ is a $16\times 16$ matrix. We have apparently captured from the initial set of $(227 \times 228)/2 = 25,878$ independent elements of the covariance matrix a small subset (only 136 in this case) of linear combinations of these 25k elements that really matter. If two covariance matrices give the same set of $C_{\alpha\beta}$, it should not matter whether any of the other eighty thousand elements differ from one another.
	
	Ultimately, what matters is how well the likelihood does at extracting parameter constraints. Since most analyses assume a Gaussian likelihood, this boils down to how well the contours in parameter space agree when computing the $\chi^2$ using two different covariance matrices.	
	
	% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	\figref{compressiony1} compares the constraints obtained for the compressed covariance matrix and data set with results from the full one. The two curves agree extremely well for the parameters shown: $\Omega_m$, $S_8$ and $A$. This is also true for all the other cosmological and intrinsic alignment parameters, where their mean values agree at the $2 \sigma$ confidence level. While the volume of the whole constrained parameter space does increase by about 13\%, the constraints for most parameters are less than 4\% broader, which shows that the information loss is negligible.

		\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Compression/Compressed_omS8A.pdf}

	\end{figure}
	
	One relevant point in this analysis is at which point to take the derivative of each parameter. When we wish to compare the results of our compression scheme with those obtained with the full covariance matrix and data set, it is important to derivate each parameter at their respective mean value (obtained by performing the analysis with the full covariance matrix). The shape and variance of the posterior is not dependent on the derivative, but the best-fit value shifts according to the point where the derivative is taken.
	
	We also apply this methodology to comparing the covariance matrices of interest, i. e. CL and BJ. In order to do this, we take two different approaches: first, we assume that $U_{\alpha, i}$ is the same for both covariance matrices and we calculate it with CL. The second approach is that each compression scheme must use the original covariance matrix that will be compressed, so that $U_{\alpha, i}$ will be different for each covariance matrix. We find that the mean values of the parameter constraints for the two methods agree to $1 \sigma$, which shows that they are equivalent to each other. \figref{correlation} is obtained for the first method, which will be the one adopted from here on, it shows the correlation matrix for BJ and CL, and the difference between the diagonal elements. We find this figure important because we can clearly see the difference between the two matrices by simply looking at only $(16 \times 17)/2$ elements, as opposed to having to analyse the larger correlation matrix for the full covariance matrices. It is also crucial that the matrices used for comparison here are those obtained via the same compression scheme, so that we can be sure that their differences are indeed only related to the differences in the original matrices.

	\section{Tolerance of the Compressed Matrices}
	\label{sec:tolerance}
	
	Now that we have shown that we are indeed able to compress the covariance matrix into a much simpler and considerably smaller one, our next step is to analyse the amount of error the elements can tolerate while reproducing compatible parameter constraints. In the next sections we test two different ways of perturbing the covariance matrix: first we consider an error to the elements themselves, and then we follow a similar procedure to study the effects of introducing error to the eigenvalues.
	
	One of the issues that arises when arbitrarily modifying the elements of the covariance matrix is that the new one does not necessarily remain positive definite. In this analysis, we take an extra step to ensure that this characteristic is retained.
	
	\subsection{Modifying the elements}
	
	To quantify the error tolerance of the elements of the covariance matrix, we introduce error in the following manner: consider that we want to test the impact of an error $x \%$; this can either be an increase of a decrease in the original element, such that what we care about most is not whether the parameter constraints will be larger, but rather how different. For this error to be random, but centred at our desired percentage, we draw $\delta$ from a Gaussian distribution, $\mathcal{G}(0,\frac{x}{100})$ and calculate the new value to be
	\be \label{eq:tolerance}
	C_{\alpha \beta}^{\mathrm{new}} = (1 + \delta)C_{\alpha \beta}^{\mathrm{old}}\ .
	\ee
	We keep the matrix symmetric by making $C_{\alpha \beta}$ = $C_{\beta \alpha}$, and, finally, we check for positive definiteness. We show the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ in Fig. \rf{tolerance}, in black for the original, compressed, covariance matrix and compare with those obtained using this procedure in orange. We see that errors of up to 25\% translate to $< 10\%$ difference in the constraints. A $30\%$ error, on the other hand, changes results in a difference of $33\%$ and $24\%$, respectively. It is worth noting here that we also find that $S_8$ is less sensitive to these errors.
	
	\begin{figure}
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Tolerance_errors.pdf}
		\caption{An error plot showing the changes to the constraints for $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ for errors added at $5\%$, 10\%, 15\%, 25\% and 30\% of the original elements (in black) and eigenvalues (in blue) of the compressed covariance matrix. The green rectangle englobes the $2 \sigma$ interval obtained for the original CL covariance matrix, and the green line shows the mean value for the respective parameter. } \label{fig:tolerance}
	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{Modifying the eigenvalues}
	
	Another way of introducing error to the covariance matrix is to perturb its eigenvalues. For a symmetric matrix, we have
	\be
	C_{\alpha \beta} = Q\Lambda Q^{-1}\ ,
	\ee
	where $\Lambda = \lambda I$, with $\lambda$ being the eigenvalues and $I$ the identity matrix; and $Q$ is a square matrix whose columns are composed of the eigenvectors of $C_{\alpha \beta}$. The eigenvalues are then perturbed as described in Eq. \ref{eq:tolerance}, with an extra step to guarantee $\delta > 1$, then $\lambda^{\mathrm{new}} > 0$, thus keeping the matrix positive definite.
	
	The results for this method are also plotted in Fig. \rf{tolerance}, in blue, for $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$. In general, we find that we are not able to reproduce significant changes to the parameter constraints, even with $30\%$ errors, as the resulting constraints are all within $5\%$ of the original one. As such, it is not clear that the results obtained using this procedure is equivalent to modifying the actual elements of the covariance matrix.

	\section{Conclusion}
	\label{sec:conclusion}
	
	In this work we set out to explore efficient ways of comparing, analysing and compressing covariance matrices. We started off looking at the parameter constraints of two $227 \times 227$ covariance matrices CL and BJ, generated for DESY1 cosmic shear measurements, that, although some of their elements differed by several orders of magnitude, they generated similar constraints. It was clear, then, that now all elements contribute equally to the parameter constraints, and we moved on to employ increasingly complicated methods to try and locate the most relevant parts of the covariance matrix.
	
	The first step was then to analyse the eigenvalues. We begin with the hypothesis that modes associated with the lowest eigenvalues have the lowest variance and therefore carry most information, as such, those with the highest eigenvalues would contribute less to parameter estimation. This proved to be untrue: ``removing" the highest 200 eigenvalues, by setting them to nine orders of magnitude higher resulted in a loss of about 200\% on the constraining power. Next, we moved on to the signal-to-noise ratio, and, using a similar procedure adopted for the eigenvalues, we ``removed" the modes with the lowest SNR. The results showed us that these modes did not contribute significantly to constraining some cosmological parameters, like $\Omega_m$, but constraints on the intrinsic alignment parameters, and even $S_8$ were very much affected. This is consistent with the fact that the IA parameters are more sensitive to low SNR, and it shows us that we need to look at the SNR per parameter before making any cuts, so that we do not lose important information for the parameters that we want to constrain.
	
	Finally, we explored methods of shrinking the covariance matrix. We explored two such methods: a tomographic compression, and another directly on the two-point functions. For the first method, we decompose the shear power spectrum into KL modes, then we look for those with the highest SNR. We thus go from ten tomographic bins to only one or two. The consecutive covariance matrix, for one mode, is then reduced from $190 \times 190$ to $19 \times 19$, showing a reduction of about $99\%$. We show, however, that one mode is not sufficient for constraining the parameters of our model, with the results being similar to our previous tests involving SNR: the constraints for $\Omega_m$, for example, are reproduced with the first and second KL-mode, but this is not the case for the IA parameters. Since extensive information of IA parameters is contained in low SNR KL-mode, the high KL-modes failed to break the degeneracy of $A-S_8$ correlation, thus causing a wider $S_8$ constraints. As for the second compression scheme, we use linear combinations of the data vector. By transforming the data vector and covariance matrix with a weighting vector that is parameter dependent, we were able to reduce the $227 \times 227$ matrix to a $16 \times 16$, and since the Fisher matrix is identical for both the original and compressed ones, the compression scheme is lossless. This is also clear in the parameter constraints, where we show that we are able to reproduce the similar constraints for the two matrices, for all parameters. On the other hand, we compared the elements of the compressed covariance matrix for CL and BJ and found that the new elements show reasonable agreement, with their correlation matrices being very similar, and the diagonal elements showing a percentage difference of less than $15\%$.
	
	One last step was taken to analyse the error tolerance of the compressed covariance matrix. We first introduced random errors of $5\%, 10\%, 15\%, 20\%, 25\%$ and $30\%$ and found that the constraints are consistent with the original ones for an error of up to $25\%$; errors larger than that cause the constraints to increase. We also applied these errors to the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, and found the differences in the constraints to be less than $3\%$, even for those larger than $25\%$.
